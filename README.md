This is a group work in my post-graduate program.

About the assignment: The dataset contains a series of monthly riderships between January 1991 and March 2004 of a US railway company named Amtrak. Here we focus on forecasting future ridership using the series of monthly ridership.

Method: we use ARIMA model to forecast future values of time series data.
